## Abstract
In this paper we use the nested cross validation method in order to fine
tune and test the perfomance of 5 machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Linear
Discriminant Analysis, on the Hepatitis C dataset. After fine tuning the algorithms we select the one with the best perfomance on the dataset and we
evaluate several perfomance metrics on the dataset.


## Dataset description 
The [Hepatitis C dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset)
 is an openly available
dataset which consist of 14 attributes
