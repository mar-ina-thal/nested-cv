# Abstract
In this paper we use the nested cross validation method in order to fine
tune and test the perfomance of 5 machine learning algorithms, namely Sup-
port Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Linear
Discriminant Analysis, on the Hepatitis C dataset. After fine tuning the al-
gorithms we select the one with the best perfomance on the dataset and we
evaluate several perfomance metrics on the dataset.


# Dataset description 
The Hepatitis C dataset is an openly available
dataset which consist of 14 attributes
